      <h3>Digital Music Collection Website</h3>
      <h4> Adobe Photoshop </h4>
      <p class="blub">This website design was created for a school assignment, where we were asked to design and create a collection for The Smithsonian. I chose to create a Digital Music Collection, where users could look through top billboard hits from every year since 1946. Facets of this website include an interactive map, interactive timeline, various multimedia and the collection itself. As the project revolves around a large scope of information, there would also be a tag system throughout the website itself, which would help users find the information that they are looking for. The website design is simple, easy to use and easy to read through to mimic the design of the actual Smithsonian website. </p>
