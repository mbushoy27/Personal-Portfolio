          <h3>Claritas MindSciences Application</h3>
          <h4> Adobe Photoshop</h4>
          <p padding="20px">This design is for a Claritas MindSciences, a health and wellness company. The company has two different programs, Craving to Quit and Eat Right Now. As these two programs deal with different health and wellness issues, they currently have two very different phone applications. I was posed with the job of creating on application where both of these different programs can reside. As you can see below, the "Current Design" shows the two separate apps side by side. The "New Design" shows the single app, where the user can choose which program they would like to work with. </p>
